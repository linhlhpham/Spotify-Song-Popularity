# Spotify Songs' Popularity: A Genre-Based Analysis of Audio Features

**TL;DR:** This project analyzed factors influencing song popularity on Spotify across different genres. The process included:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Box plots, heatmaps, histograms, and scatterplots
2. K-Means Clustering
3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Key findings:
- Linear regression was not suitable due to low correlations between variables
- Top 5 genres by median popularity: Pop, Pop-film, K-pop, Hip-hop, and Chill
- Each genre had unique characteristics contributing to popularity:
  - Hip-hop: Less danceable, quieter, and moodier songs were more popular
  - Pop: Explicit lyrics, high danceability, upbeat tempo, moderate loudness
  - K-pop: Higher loudness and positive mood correlated with popularity
  - Chill: High explicitness, moderate danceability, tempo, and loudness
  - Pop-film: Diverse range of characteristics, suggesting flexibility in production

The study concluded that while these patterns exist, not all popular songs fit neatly into these templates. The findings provide insights for producers to understand prevailing aesthetics and create music that resonates with mainstream audiences.
